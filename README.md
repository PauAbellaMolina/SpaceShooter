# Space Shooter

I created a classic and simple Space Shooter for my M9 module project.

I used [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com) for [Angular](https://angular.io) (and [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/)) alongside a framework specifically build for Javascript/Typescript games called [Phaser](https://phaser.io/).

Using Ionic for this project gave me two huge advantages:
- Making the game cross platform, meaning you can both play it on the web, or you can install it as an app on Android (which is cool).
- I only had to code "once" for both the web and the app version (which is practical).
